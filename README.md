# Explore-Video-Games-Sales
Analysis and visualizations of Video Game Sales

## Summary:
Why I did this project? I choose to do this project because I like to play a lot of video games. It's great stress relief and some games are just so much fun to play and its such a perfect escape from the world . The important fields that I used are the columns about game names , Platform of the games release, Year of the game's releaseï¼Œ and the sales data in different regions. 

My tech stack? I mainly used pandas and Numpy modules ,and seaborn, matplotlib and wordcloud modules to create visualizations about the video games sales in order to gain interesting findings.
