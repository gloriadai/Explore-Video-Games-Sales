Analysis and visualizations of Video Game Sales

## Summary:
Why I did this project? I choose to do this project because I like to play a lot of video games. It's great stress relief and some games are just so much fun to play and its such a perfect escape from the world . The important fields that I used are the columns about game names , Platform of the games release, Year of the game's release， and the sales data in different regions. 

My tech stack? I mainly used pandas and Numpy modules ,and seaborn, matplotlib and wordcloud modules to create visualizations about the video games sales in order to gain interesting findings. 

### Key Visualizations
Below are three key visualizations that can give us an overall picture of video games sales across the world.

#### 1:Which platform has the most games selection?

Nintendo DS has the most number of video games selection in its platform, followed by PS2.I also noticed that PS3, Wii , and Xbox 360 has only about 50% of the games selection compared to Nintendo DS and PS2. 

#### 2：How sales overall have done since 1980?

We can see that sales have been continually increasing. There was a peak in 2008, which was around the start of the recession, which affected the video game industry as severely as many other industries.Also, North America has been the leader in video game sales for the most part,however, Japan looks like it was able to surpass North America briefly between 1992 and 1996.

#### 3：For consoles like Wii, Playstation and Xbox, what were the global sales over the past 10 years?

Nintendo DS had made huge success in sales during the 2005 to 2010 time span. Playstation overtook the top selling spot during the 2011-2016.The sales in Nintendo dramatically decrease during the 2011-2016 time span.
